styles
======

You'll find here a .less file corresponding to each in the Active Commerce base skin.
Each contains a default "recipe" which pulls in base files plus your skin-specific mixins + variables (found under /common).

1. Tweak the base variables to suit your style (/common/variables.less)
2. Add any less mixins that we don't have in the base (/common/mixins.less)
3. Add your styles throughout (look for "// DEFINE xxxxxx HERE"). Use [less](http://lesscss.org/) (recommended) or plain old css.
